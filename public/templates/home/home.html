        <h4>1) Prepare your XML</h4>
        <p>
            The input for Narthex is XML (either as text or GZipped text). The first step for you is to dump your data to XML
            and decide if you want to put it in a zip package. </p>

        <h4>2) Login and Upload</h4>

        <p>
            Before uploading your XML you must register/login to Narthex.
            Once logged in, all you have to do is drag  and drop the xml source package on to the dashboard file-drop area.
            The analysis will begin immediately. </p>

        <h4>3) Explore</h4>

        <p>
            When the initial analysis is complete, you will be able to explore the tree that represents the XML
            structure.
            The complete analysis continues in the background, and should be complete within a few minutes.
            All values are sorted, collated and counted, and histograms are made available. </p>

        <h4>4) Review and Access</h4>

        <p>
            When the second phase of analysis is complete, the resulting tree and terminology lists can be explored in
            detail,
            and they are then also available for other software to access via the REST API. The API link contains
            a key which gives permission. </p>

        <h4>5) Think about the Potential</h4>

        <p>

            and let us know about it! (narthex@delving.eu)
